    <h1>Title: 4 AM in Girona</h1>
    <h1>Artist: Taco Hemingway</h1>
    <h3>Verse 1</h3>
    <p>Running from the fame<br>
      In a rented Beemer, 140 in the rain <br>
      I remember I was hoping for a change <br>
      Funny how I really don't want it, once it came <br>
      Paparazzi on a lookout <br>
      Come on, little baby, look proud <br>
      By the way though she hates being called a model <br>
      That ain't fair, cause she's only into books now <br>
      We fucked around made a new sound, goddamn <br>
      Fucked around, made a new sound, goddamn <br>
      Fucked around, made a few stacks, goddamm <br>
      I fucked around I got the blues now <br>
      I'm staying in Brussels and London now <br>
      And only my real people come around <br>
      The people that I'm leaving in the past <br>
      Keep calling to lend them a couple thou', huh</p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>I don't like that <br>
      I don't really like that <br>
      I remember messaging my idols <br>
      Hoping that they write back <br>
      But they never write back <br>
      Why they never write back? <br>
      (Why they never write back?) <br>
      I remember teasing my demons <br>
      Hoping that they bite back, argh! <br>
      I don't like that <br>
      I don't really like that <br>
      Now I got these kids in my DMs (DMs) <br>
      Begging me to write back (uh huh) <br>
      I don't write back (I don't write back) <br>
      Why I never write back? (why I never write back?) <br>
      I remember messaging my heroes (heroes) <br>
      Feeling like a psychopath</p>
